# Terraform_RestAPI_IAC
## Description

This project features Terraform code that deploys a REST API, along with a DynamoDB table and a Lambda function.

The implementation follows point 12 from the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/), which emphasizes the use of IaC. 

Instead of manually configuring API resources through the AWS console, this project utilizes Terraform to define and manage the infrastructure.

**All hail Terraform**
